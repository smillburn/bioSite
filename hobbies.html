                        Dungeons and dragons is the oldest fantasy game. Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop role
                        playing game. The setting for the game is usually pretty close to medieval. So players run
                        around the world with swords, axes, and spells to take on mythical beasts like dragons, hydras,
                        and goblins. Playing in a game purely fueled by imagination is engaging and presents itself with
                        unique challenges. Banding together in the basement of your friend's home with pizza and soda at
                        1am at night trying to figure out how to get past a trap door in a world of make believe. Roll
                        the dice and wait and see if you succeed or fail.

                        Ashley has had a history of growing up near video games. Her father often played
                        games and they had several game consoles at their house. She typically plays casually for fun
                        rather than in a competitive role. She has not tied herself down to a single console/brand.
                        Playing games on the Wii, Xbox, pc, and ps4. Lately her favorite games have been Borderlands,
                        Conan Exiles, Garry’s Mod, and Valheim. Borderlands is a 1st person shooter that encourages
                        people to play with friends. The game is primarily player vs environment meaning it is her/her
                        friends against the game not player against player. Both Conan Exiles and Valheim are survival
                        games where you try to keep your avatar alive. The game mimics some different real-life
                        mechanics like food, water, sleeping and building shelters. Garry’s mod is a suite of games. Her
                        typical favorite is called prop hunt which is kind of like hide and seek except the ones hiding
                        are trying to hide as everyday objects like a cup, fridge, shelf, and even a hotdog.

                        Cave drawings one thousand years old to a digital portfolio of photoshopped content. Art
                        has branched into many mediums, but has had the same core purpose; To portray the world the
                        artist sees. For her, she uses my talents to process my emotions and express myself through
                        my art. Ashley’s favorite medium to work with is charcoal. she is also proficient with ink
                        pens, graphite pencils, and colored pens/markers. The majority of Ashley’s work is done with
                        pencil/pen and paper. However, as of recently, I am gravitating to ink pens again. Ashley’s
                        work has been described as experimental; she try’s new techniques and styles often.
                        Switching mediums and emphasis. Ashley’s work definitely reflects my frame of mind at the
                        time. She can see the difference in my work on the days she was inspired and focused versus
                        the days that she was drained and tired. But she does not look at the work she did on those
                        days as ‘bad’, it is what it is. She never throws away her work. She has the tools and means
                        to correct mistakes and make embellishments, but more often than not she will leave the
                        piece be. It captured how she was in that moment in time and she see that as a frame of
                        reference for her personally; a personal portfolio of her and her progression as an artist.

                        For Ashley, music is a very personal experience. Everything from the lyrics to the key
                        change at the second chorus. Ashley believes each song in an album is one chapter in a book.
                        The singer/songwriters write the lyrics to say a message or portray an emotion; they choose
                        the key and tempo to carry that message. The album is a book and should be listened to in
                        order because that's the way the artists intended it. You wouldn't read a book out of order,
                        skipping every other chapter, why listen to an album out of order. With that being said, not
                        all artists have a story or intention with their music. She does not resonate with every
                        song she hears. Music has such a wide range of genres and artists; it is impossible to hold
                        every artist to the same standard. she believes music is an art form and art are interpreted
                        by the beholder. Ashley’s fondest memory related to music is the 2016 live Coldplay concert
                        she and her husband attended in Chicago. Vivid colors flashing all around the crowd and the
                        waves of hands and arms looked like a field of grass moving with the breeze. Everything felt
                        alive. She keeps the ticket stubs on a memory board in her art studio.
